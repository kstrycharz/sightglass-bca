"""Rendering a gate verdict for a build log.

A CI failure message is read by someone who did not run the scan, is not a
security engineer, and wants to know three things in the first five lines: did
it fail, what failed it, and what do I do now. Everything here is shaped around
that, which is why the remediation hint is not optional and the inherited
findings are summarised rather than listed.
