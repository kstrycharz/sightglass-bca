"""Static scan analyzer: strings, rule matching, entropy, file identification.

Runs inside a locked-down container with no network. It reads the artifact from
``/input``, the rule pack from ``/rules``, and writes one JSON document to
``/output/result.json``.

It shares ``core.rules`` with the host rather than reimplementing the scanner,
so the engine that produces findings in production is the same one the unit
tests exercise. The alternative — a standalone script that drifts from the
tested code — is how a scanner quietly stops matching.
