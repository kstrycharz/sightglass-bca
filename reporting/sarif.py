"""SARIF 2.1.0 output.

SARIF is how a finding stops being a wall of CI log text and becomes an
annotation on the pull request that introduced it. GitHub code scanning,
GitLab, Azure DevOps, and every serious IDE read it, which means the fastest
path to "developers actually see this" is emitting it correctly rather than
building a bespoke integration per platform.

Two decisions worth stating:

**Masked values only.** A SARIF file is uploaded to a code-scanning service and
often retained long past the run. Putting candidate secret plaintext in it
would re-leak the exact thing the tool exists to catch (§14). Every message
carries the masked value and the rule, never the secret.

**Levels are not severities.** SARIF has three result levels; the product has
five severities. The mapping is lossy in one direction, so the original
severity is preserved in ``properties`` and in the rule metadata, which is what
platform filtering and the security-severity score actually read.
