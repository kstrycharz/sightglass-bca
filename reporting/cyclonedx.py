"""CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM export.

The format everything downstream consumes — Dependency-Track, GitHub, most
procurement processes — so it is the first reporting output that matters for
composition analysis.

Two decisions worth stating:

**Evidence, not assertion.** Every component carries how it was identified.
CycloneDX 1.5 has `evidence.identity` with a `confidence` field for exactly
this, and using it is the difference between an SBOM a security team trusts and
one they stop reading. A manifest declaration and a version banner scraped out
of a stripped binary are both useful; presenting them as the same kind of fact
is not.

**Deterministic.** No timestamp from the clock, no random serial — the serial
is derived from the run id. Two exports of the same run are byte-identical, so
an SBOM can be hashed, attached to a release, and compared between builds. A
document that differs on every render makes every diff useless, which is most
of what an SBOM is for.
