"""Request-scoped dependencies: authentication and scope enforcement.

The posture here is fail-closed. If authentication is enabled and anything
about the credential is wrong — absent, malformed, unknown, revoked, expired,
or insufficiently scoped — the request is refused. There is no path that
degrades to "allow" on error, because the one thing worse than an API with no
authentication is an API that appears to have some.
