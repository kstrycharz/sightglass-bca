"""Liveness and readiness.

``/healthz`` answers "is this process alive" and must stay dependency-free so a
crash-looping database can't take the container down with it. ``/readyz``
answers "can this process actually do work", checks every dependency, and is
what the compose healthcheck and Kubernetes readiness probe use.
