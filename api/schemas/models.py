"""API response shapes.

Deliberately separate from the SQLAlchemy models. The wire format is a
contract with the dashboard and with CI consumers; the database schema is an
implementation detail, and coupling them means every column rename becomes a
breaking API change.

Note how AI-derived fields are grouped into a single nullable ``llm`` object
rather than spread across the finding. The dashboard's "deterministic view
only" toggle is then one field to drop, not six to remember (§2.5).
