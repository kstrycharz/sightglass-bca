"""Policy evaluation: findings in, a release decision out.

Pure and deterministic. No database, no network, no model. The same findings
and the same policy produce the same verdict on any machine, which is the only
way a gate is defensible in an audit — "the build failed because clause X
matched finding Y" has to be reproducible six months later.

The ordering rules matter and are explicit:

1. A degraded scan is considered *before* findings. An incomplete scan cannot
   support a PASS, and letting a clean-but-partial result through is the
   failure mode that makes a gate worse than useless.
2. Waivers apply only to findings that would otherwise block, and an expired
   waiver is itself a violation rather than a silent no-op.
3. Budgets are counted after the severity floor, over the findings that
   survived it, so a budget cannot mask a blocking finding.
