"""Recovering runs whose task was lost.

Celery is configured with ``task_reject_on_worker_lost=False`` on purpose: a
worker killed mid-analysis must not have its task silently retried onto another
worker, because analyzer containers are not free and a hung artifact would just
be re-hung. The comment that decision carries has always said "the run state
machine decides retries" — this module is that decision, which until now did
not exist.

Without it the failure is silent and permanent: a scan queued while a worker
restarts is acknowledged, dropped, and the run sits at ``queued`` for ever with
no error, no timeout, and a dashboard row that looks like it is about to start.
Observed in practice on a 203 MB installer during a routine redeploy.

The two cases are deliberately not treated alike:

* **Queued and never started.** No analyzer ran, nothing was consumed, and
  re-dispatching costs one message. These are requeued, a bounded number of
  times, because the honest state is "not attempted yet".
* **Running past every stage timeout.** A worker died mid-analysis, or the
  artifact hung something the watchdog could not reach. Re-running risks
  repeating whatever wedged it, so these fail with a diagnosis. That is
  ADR-0008's posture — a degraded result that says so beats a silent retry.

Attempts are counted from the audit log rather than a column, so the trail an
operator reads is the same one the sweep reasons about.
