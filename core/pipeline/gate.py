"""Bridge between a stored run and the release gate.

:mod:`core.policy` is deliberately free of the database (ADR-0011's reasoning,
one layer out), so the projection from ORM rows to :class:`GateFinding` lives
here, where the pipeline already owns a session.

The baseline resolution is the interesting part. "Is this finding new?" is a
set difference over content-derived finding ids (ADR-0010) against a
predecessor run, and the predecessor is chosen in this order:

1. an explicitly supplied run id — what a pipeline promoting a specific release
   candidate should pass;
2. an explicitly supplied set of ids — what an air-gapped or repo-committed
   baseline file provides;
3. ``run.previous_run_id``, linked at scan time to the last completed run of a
   same-named artifact.

If none resolves, every finding is new. That is the safe direction: a first
scan with no history blocks on everything it finds rather than silently
treating an unknown baseline as "all of this was already there".
