"""The scan pipeline: stage, unpack, scan, correlate, persist.

Two analyzer passes rather than one container per file. The unpack container
walks the artifact recursively and writes the whole tree to disk; the static
container then scans that entire tree in a single pass. A container per
extracted file would turn a 400-file installer into 400 container starts —
minutes of pure overhead for milliseconds of work.

Provenance survives the whole way: every finding location carries the path that
produced it, so the report says
``release.zip → payload.tar.gz → config/prod.json`` rather than naming a
temporary directory.
