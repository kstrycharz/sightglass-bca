"""Orphaned-container cleanup.

If the orchestrator crashes mid-run, its containers keep running, holding
memory and CPU that the next run needs. The reaper is the backstop: it runs
periodically, looks at everything labelled ``sightglass.managed``, and removes
whatever belongs to a run that is no longer active or that has outlived the
maximum age.

Deliberately conservative in one direction: it will never remove a container
whose run id is in the active set, no matter how old, because a legitimately
long Ghidra job must not be reaped out from under a live run. The watchdog owns
deadlines; the reaper owns orphans.
