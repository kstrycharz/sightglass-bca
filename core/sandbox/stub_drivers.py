"""Placeholder drivers for runtimes we have committed to but not yet built.

These exist so the driver registry, config schema, and docs can reference
``podman`` and ``gvisor`` today, and so that selecting one fails immediately
and legibly rather than silently degrading to Docker. Per the working
agreement, nothing here pretends to work: every method raises.

Tracked in CLAUDE.md "Known issues & tech debt". Podman (rootless) is required
by many enterprises and is scheduled for M6; gVisor is a defence-in-depth
option for operators analysing third-party artifacts.
