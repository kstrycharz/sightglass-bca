"""The sandbox driver interface.

Analyzer code never imports a concrete runtime. It asks a :class:`SandboxDriver`
to run a :class:`~core.sandbox.spec.SandboxSpec` and gets back a
:class:`SandboxResult`. That indirection is why Podman (rootless) and gVisor can
land later without touching a single analyzer — retrofitting it would mean
rewriting every analyzer, which is exactly the trap this interface avoids.
