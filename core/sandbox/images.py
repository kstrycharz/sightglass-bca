"""Analyzer image names, in one place.

The tag was hard-coded to ``dev`` in eight files — the Makefile, its PowerShell
twin, the scan pipeline, the orchestrator, the CLI, CI, and two test modules.
That is fine while the only deployment is a developer's laptop and wrong the
moment anyone ships a versioned build, because there is no way to say "run
0.1.0" without editing source.

Resolution order, most specific first:

1. ``SIGHTGLASS_<NAME>_IMAGE`` — a complete image reference for one analyzer,
   e.g. ``SIGHTGLASS_STATIC_IMAGE=registry.internal/sightglass/static@sha256:...``.
   This predates the tag setting and keeps working; it is also the only way to
   pin a digest or move one analyzer to a different registry.
2. ``SIGHTGLASS_ANALYZER_TAG`` — the tag applied to every analyzer repository.
   The common case: ``latest``, a release version, or a git sha.
3. ``dev`` — unchanged from before, so existing workflows need no flags.

Read from the environment at call time rather than captured at import. The
constants this replaces were evaluated once when the module first loaded, which
meant a test (or a worker that set the variable after start-up) could not
change them.
