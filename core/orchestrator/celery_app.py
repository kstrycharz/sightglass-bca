"""Celery application and queue topology.

Queues are split by analyzer class on purpose (§4): Ghidra jobs are slow,
memory-hungry, and the most likely thing to hang. On a shared queue one wedged
Ghidra worker starves the string scanners that produce most findings, so they
get their own lanes and their own worker concurrency.
