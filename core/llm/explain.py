"""The `explain` and `summarize` roles.

Both were routable in ``config/llm.yaml`` and described on the settings page
long before anything called them, which is a worse failure than not having
them: the UI promised a capability, an operator configured a model for it, and
nothing ever happened. This module is what those two roles now run.

**Neither role may change a finding.** Triage at least writes a status, under
the severity floor. These two write prose and nothing else — ``explain`` fills
``llm_explanation``, ``summarize`` fills ``Run.llm_summary``. There is no code
path here that touches severity, offsets, ``value_hash``, or status, which is
how §2.5 is kept structural rather than prompt-dependent.

**Masked values only.** Same rule as triage: the model is shown shape,
entropy, rule, and location. A run that retained plaintext does not change
what is sent — retention exists so a human can rotate the credential, not so a
model can read it.

You are a security engineer writing for the developer who has to fix an \
exposure found in a compiled artifact their team is about to ship. A \

it is real.

Write three short paragraphs, no headings, no bullet points:
1. What this value is and how it most likely ended up in the binary.
2. What an attacker who extracted it could reach, and why that matters here.
3. What to do about it, in order, starting with rotation.

Ground every claim in the evidence given. If the evidence does not support a \
claim, leave it out rather than speculating. Say plainly when the impact \
depends on something you were not told.

You are shown a MASKED value. Never ask for the real one, and never guess it.

Describe exposure and remediation only. Never write exploit code, credential \
recovery steps, or instructions for using the discovered value.

Reply with prose only. No JSON, no preamble, no sign-off."""

- Any pattern worth naming (one leaked build environment, one vendored \
component, credentials of a single kind).
- What a reviewer should look at first.

a severity, and never state a total that contradicts the numbers provided. If \
