"""LiteLLM adapter — one transport, a hundred-odd providers.

Replaces the hand-written OpenAI/Anthropic/Google adapters. The maintenance
argument is straightforward: every vendor changes its wire format eventually,
and tracking that across a growing list is not this project's job.

**How egress is enforced, and why it is not where you would expect.**

LiteLLM has no single choke point. Measured, not assumed: setting
``litellm.client_session`` to an httpx client with a request hook catches the
OpenAI family and *nothing else* — Anthropic, Gemini, and Groq route through
their own handlers and never touch it. Explicit ``api_base`` is honoured by
Anthropic but ignored by Gemini. So neither mechanism can carry the air-gap
guarantee on its own.

The guarantee therefore lives one level up, where it is absolute: **a provider
whose endpoint is not local cannot be constructed at all under a deny policy.**
`build_provider` checks locality before this class is instantiated, and
`load_config` refuses the whole config at startup. An air-gapped deployment
cannot hold a hosted provider, so there is no request for LiteLLM to route.

Everything below is defence in depth on top of that: the `api_base` check where
we have one, the client-session hook for the providers that honour it, and
telemetry off.
