"""LLM triage.

What this does: takes deterministic findings and classifies each as
true_positive, false_positive, or needs_review, with reasoning.

What it emphatically does not do: create findings. §2.5 is binding — a model
may suppress or demote, never invent. Enforced structurally rather than by
prompt: this module receives existing ``Finding`` rows and writes only to
``status``, ``llm_verdict``, ``llm_reasoning``, ``llm_model``, and ``llm_at``.
It has no code path that constructs a Finding, and the severity floor below
prevents demoting a critical out of sight.

Why it matters: deterministic rules are deliberately over-inclusive, because
missing a live key is far worse than surfacing a dud. That trade is only
tolerable if something collapses the false positives afterwards. This is that
something.

You are a security analyst triaging candidate secrets found in a compiled \
artifact that a company is about to ship. A deterministic scanner already \
matched these; your job is to judge whether each is a real exposure.

Judge on evidence, not vibes:
- Documentation examples, RFC sample values, and obvious placeholders are \
false positives.
- Test fixtures and sample data may still be real exposures if the value looks \
live.
- High entropy plus a credential-shaped variable name is usually a true \
positive.
- Low entropy, dictionary words, and version strings usually are not.
- If you genuinely cannot tell from the evidence, say needs_review. That is a \
useful answer, not a failure.

You will be shown MASKED values. You are judging the shape, the context, and \
the location - never the secret itself.

Describe exposure and remediation only. Never produce exploit code, credential \
recovery techniques, or instructions for using a discovered secret.
