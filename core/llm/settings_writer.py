"""Editing `config/llm.yaml` from the console.

The file stays the source of truth and stays hot-reloadable — this writes it,
it does not shadow it with a database table. An operator who edits the YAML by
hand and an operator who uses the settings page must not end up with two
different notions of which model is running.

Two things make that safe:

* **The document is rewritten from a parsed copy, not regenerated.** Unknown
  keys, ordering and the comments that explain the role routing all survive,
  because a config file people are expected to read by hand loses most of its
  value the first time a UI reformats it.
* **The result is validated before it replaces anything**, and written through
  a temporary file in the same directory. A half-written config is how a
  deployment discovers its scanner cannot start.
