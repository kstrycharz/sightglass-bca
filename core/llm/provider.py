"""Provider abstraction and egress enforcement.

The trust boundary lives here. Two rules, both enforced in code rather than by
convention because "we're careful about it" is not something a security team
can audit:

1. **Egress is allowlisted.** A request to a host that policy does not permit
   raises before any bytes leave the process.
2. **Plaintext never reaches a remote provider.** Candidate secrets are sent as
   shape, entropy, rule name, masked value, and offsets. Local providers may
   receive plaintext only under a separate, explicit opt-in.
