"""API tokens: minting, hashing, and scope checks.

Dependency-light on purpose — stdlib only — so the token logic can be tested
and reasoned about without a database or a web framework in the way.

**Why SHA-256 and not bcrypt/argon2.** Password hashes are slow because
passwords are low-entropy and guessable. These tokens are 256 bits from
``secrets.token_urlsafe``; there is no dictionary to attack and no user-chosen
weak input, so a slow KDF would buy nothing and cost a round trip on every
request. What matters instead is that the plaintext is never stored, the
comparison is constant-time, and the lookup is by hash so a leaked database
does not yield usable tokens.

**Why scopes exist at all.** ADR-0019 says findings do not travel to CI: a
findings list is a company's exposed secrets in one document. A build agent
needs to submit an artifact and read a verdict; it has no business reading the
corpus. That distinction is only real if the token enforces it.
