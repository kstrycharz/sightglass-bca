"""String extraction and rule matching over binary data.

This is where most findings come from, and two details decide whether the tool
is actually useful:

**UTF-16LE.** Windows binaries keep a large share of their strings as wide
characters, and a scanner that only walks ASCII misses roughly half the secrets
in a typical `.exe`. Both encodings are extracted, and the encoding is carried
through to the finding so a reviewer can see which one it came from.

**Offsets.** A finding that says "this key is in the binary" is an argument. A
finding that says "at 0x4a2c, in .rdata, as a wide string" is a fix. Offsets are
preserved from extraction all the way to the report.
