"""A run whose analyzers did not finish must not report as completed.

The field failure: the static analyzer failed an import, exited 1 in under a
second, and the scan recorded `status=completed, findings=0` for a 213 MB
installer. Nothing had been examined. The gate caught it — that is what
ADR-0018 is for — but the run, the API and the dashboard all said the artifact
was clean, and only the gate disagreed.

So these tests hold two things together: that a degraded stage changes the
run's own status, and that the gate and the run agree about which stages count
as degraded. Those two answers being derived separately is what allowed them to
diverge in the first place.
