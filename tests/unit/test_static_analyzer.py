"""The static analyzer's parallel scan.

The analyzer ships inside a container image, so it is not importable as a
package — it is loaded by path here. That is worth doing rather than skipping:
the worker-count logic decides how a scan is executed, and getting it wrong
either wastes seven eighths of the machine or spawns eight workers to fight
over a two-CPU quota.

The determinism guarantee (§2.5, "parallelism must not affect output") is
asserted here at the unit level; `scripts/bench_analyzer.py` asserts the same
thing end to end through a real sandboxed container.
