"""Guarantees that live in docker-compose.yml rather than in Python.

A deployment is two commands and no file editing (CLAUDE.md §2), which puts
real correctness properties in the compose file: that nothing starts against an
unmigrated database, that a wedged worker is visible, that logs cannot fill the
disk. None of those are expressible as a Python assertion about `core/`, so
they are asserted against the file itself.
