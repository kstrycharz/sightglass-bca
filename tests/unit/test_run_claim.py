"""Only one worker may scan a run.

Caught in the field, not in review. The orphan sweep requeued a run at age 399s
while its original task was still inside the static analyzer — the run had been
sitting at `queued` for the whole scan, because the RUNNING transition was
flushed inside the scan's single long transaction and never committed. A second
`scan_run` was dispatched for the same 213 MB artifact: two sets of analyzer
containers, racing to write the same rows.

Two defects, two fixes, and both are tested here because either alone leaves a
window. The transition is committed, so the run stops *looking* abandoned; and
the transition is a conditional UPDATE, so a duplicate delivery loses the race
instead of joining it. Celery is at-least-once by design, which means the
second fix has to hold even when the first one is working.
