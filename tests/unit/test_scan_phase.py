"""The phase a running scan reports.

This is what the progress bar advances on, so it has to be derived from state
the pipeline actually wrote rather than from elapsed time. A bar that moves on
a clock tells the operator nothing about whether a five-minute static stage is
working or wedged, which is the only question they opened the page to answer.

The two phases with no stage row of their own — `index` and `report` — are the
ones worth testing hardest. They are the pipeline doing its own work between
analyzers, they take tens of seconds on a large installer, and before they were
named they were exactly the windows in which the UI appeared to hang.
