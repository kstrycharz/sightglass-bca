"""Schema migrations.

The failure this exists for was live and expensive: a column was added to a
model, the deployment was rebuilt, and `create_all()` reported success because
the *table* already existed. Every request that touched the run manifest then
returned 500, and a 213 MB scan died at the manifest write with the artifact
already uploaded and unpacked.

`create_all()` is blind to a missing column by design. So the tests that matter
here are not "does the migration run" but "does a database in each of the three
states a real deployment can be in end up correct".

Migrations are exercised against SQLite: it is what the rest of the unit suite
uses, needs no Docker, and every operation these revisions perform is portable.
The Postgres-specific risk — a type that renders differently — is what
`compare_type` in `alembic/env.py` is there to catch at authoring time.

    none of them can see this class of bug.

    Postgres is not so forgiving: it validates a foreign key's target the
    moment the `CREATE TABLE` runs. `0001_baseline` created `artifacts`
    (referencing `runs`) eleven tables before it created `runs` — invisible
    here, and a crash loop on the very first boot of a real deployment. The
    fix is a real cycle, not just a reorder: `artifacts.run_id` points at
    `runs`, and `runs.root_artifact_id` points back at `artifacts`. `runs` is
    now created first without that one column's constraint, and it is closed
    with `ALTER TABLE` once `artifacts` exists — which means the downgrade has
    the same ordering hazard in reverse and needs the same care dropping it.

    These tests render each migration's DDL for the postgresql dialect via
    Alembic's own `--sql` offline mode — real SQL, no database — and replay it
