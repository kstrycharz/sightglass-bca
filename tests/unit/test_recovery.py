"""The orphaned-run sweep.

Runs against a real schema in SQLite rather than mocks, because the thing being
tested is a decision made from timestamps and audit rows — exactly what a mock
would let drift.

The bug this exists for was silent and permanent: Celery is deliberately
configured not to retry a task lost with its worker, so a scan queued during a
worker restart was acknowledged, dropped, and left at `queued` for ever with no
error and no timeout. Observed on a 203 MB installer during a redeploy.
